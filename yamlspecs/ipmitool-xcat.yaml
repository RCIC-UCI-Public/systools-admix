  description: | 
     This package contains a utility for interfacing with devices that support
     the Intelligent Platform Management Interface specification.  IPMI is
     an open standard for machine health, inventory, and remote power control.

     This utility can communicate with IPMI-enabled devices through either a
     kernel driver such as OpenIPMI or over the RMCP LAN protocol defined in
     the IPMI specification.  IPMIv2 adds support for encrypted LAN
     communications and remote Serial-over-LAN functionality.

     It provides commands for reading the Sensor Data Repository (SDR) and
     displaying sensor values, displaying the contents of the System Event
     Log (SEL), printing Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) information, reading and
     setting LAN configuration, and chassis power control.
