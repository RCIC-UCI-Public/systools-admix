  description: |
     ansible {{version}}. 
     Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. 
     Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applications -  automate in a language that 
     approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.
