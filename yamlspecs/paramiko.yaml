     paramiko {{version}}.  "Paramiko" is a combination of the Esperanto words for "paranoid" and "friend". 
     It's a module for Python 2.7/3.4+ that implements the SSH2 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) 
     connections to remote machines. Unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates 
     signed by a powerful central authority. You may know SSH2 as the protocol that replaced Telnet and rsh for secure 
     access to remote shells, but the protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services 
     across the encrypted tunnel (this is how SFTP works, for example).
