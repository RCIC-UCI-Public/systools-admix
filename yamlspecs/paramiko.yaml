     Paramiko version {{version}} is a pure-Python implementation of the SSHv2 protocol, providing both client and server functionality. 
     It provides the foundation for the high-level SSH library Fabric, which is what we recommend you use for common 
     client use-cases such as running remote shell commands or transferring files.

     Direct use of Paramiko itself is only intended for users who need advanced/low-level primitives or want to run 
     an in-Python sshd.
